# Nursery_Classification
INSE6180 Data Mining Project

The objective of this project is to implement several classification techniques using nursery dataset namely:
1) Support Vector Machine (SVM)
2) K – Nearest Neighbor (k-NN)
3) Naïve Bayes
4) Decision Tree
5) Random Forest

For the problem, we are using the [UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/nursery/) for Nursery admissions in public schools. 
The database contains 12960 instances with 8 attributes.
